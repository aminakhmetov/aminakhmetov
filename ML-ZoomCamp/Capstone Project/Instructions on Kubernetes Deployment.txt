1. Create Kind cluster:
kind create cluster
2. Get info about cluster:
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get services
3. Load docker image to cluster:
kind load docker-image cutlery:v001
4. Get up deployment and service running:
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
5. Set up port forwarding:
kubectl port-forward service/cutlery 9090:80
6. Test kubernetes deployment:

7. Note about port forwarding:
a) docker image/service is listening on 8080 port
b) deployed pod is listening on 8080 port
c) inside the kubernetes service, all requests made to 80 port will transfer to 8080 port of the pod.
d) we will forward all connections from external commands from 9090 port (by test_local_kubernetes_deployement.py) (external outside of Kubernetes) to 80 port of service, which will route it to 8080 port of Kubernetes.

8. Stop kind server: 
kind delete cluster

9. Useful commands
kubectl get pods
kubectl scale pod credit-card --replicas 0 
kubectl scale service credit-card --replicas 0
